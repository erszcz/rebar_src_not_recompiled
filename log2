Ok, I found out what's going on. It's possible to sidestep the problem,
though it still seems to be an inconsistency in Rebar3.

Let's set the stage - we have a project with a source file under a subdir of `src/`.
When we compile it the first time, everything looks good - the code returns the value
defined by the macro:

```
$ cd /tmp/src_not_recompiled/
$ rg -C1 MACRO src/
src/subdir/m.erl
7-f() ->
8:    ?MACRO.

src/header.hrl
1:-define(MACRO, t2).
$ r3 shell
===> Verifying dependencies...
===> Analyzing applications...
===> Compiling src_not_recompiled
Erlang/OTP 23 [erts-11.1.3] [source] [64-bit] [smp:8:8] [ds:8:8:10] [async-threads:1] [hipe]

Eshell V11.1.3  (abort with ^G)
1> m:f().
t2
2>
```

However, on the macro definition change, the code still returns the old value:

```
$ rg -C1 MACRO src/
src/header.hrl
1:-define(MACRO, t3).

src/subdir/m.erl
7-f() ->
8:    ?MACRO.
$ r3 shell
===> Verifying dependencies...
===> Analyzing applications...
===> Compiling src_not_recompiled
Erlang/OTP 23 [erts-11.1.3] [source] [64-bit] [smp:8:8] [ds:8:8:10] [async-threads:1] [hipe]

Eshell V11.1.3  (abort with ^G)
1> m:f().
t2
2>
```

If we move the source file directly under `src/`, though, things start working as expected:

```
$ mv src/subdir/m.erl src/
$ r3 shell
===> Verifying dependencies...
===> Analyzing applications...
===> Compiling src_not_recompiled
Erlang/OTP 23 [erts-11.1.3] [source] [64-bit] [smp:8:8] [ds:8:8:10] [async-threads:1] [hipe]

Eshell V11.1.3  (abort with ^G)
1> m:f().
t3
2>
```

So, this is an inconsistency, since *Rebar3 compiles source files found under subdirectories of `src/`, but does not recompile them if the header files they include change.*

We can fix that by modifying the `src_dirs` option in `rebar.config`:

```
$ mv src/m.erl src/subdir/
$ cat rebar.config
{erl_opts, [debug_info]}.
{deps, []}.
{src_dirs, ["src", "src/subdir"]}.
$ rg -C1 MACRO src/
src/subdir/m.erl
7-f() ->
8:    ?MACRO.

src/header.hrl
1:-define(MACRO, t4).
$ r3 shell
===> Verifying dependencies...
===> Analyzing applications...
===> Compiling src_not_recompiled
Erlang/OTP 23 [erts-11.1.3] [source] [64-bit] [smp:8:8] [ds:8:8:10] [async-threads:1] [hipe]

Eshell V11.1.3  (abort with ^G)
1> m:f().
t4
2>
```

Problem solved.
